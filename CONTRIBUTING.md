Generally we are trying to stick with the [C4](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22) process (sorry for it's formalism) but with a few exceptions:

*  You may contribute non-trivial code from other projects (while not being an original author of that code) as long as that code's license is compatible with project's license (e.g. Public Domain, MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0 or MPL 2.0 itself). Please include a link to the original code in a comment (and preferably identify the licence). Also please indentify the authors (copyright holders) of the original code in the [contributors list](/AUTHORS) with a reference as to where their code was used, if the license requires an attribution.
*  And as a temporary exception (and strongly discouraged to be employed), you may contribute non-trivial code from other projects licensed under LGPL v2.1 as long as that code is both of a critical value to the project and too complex to reimplement it right away, and is separated on a file level from the rest of the project. Please open an issue to replace the code with a compatibly licensed implementation after merging it. And please don't forget to update the License section of the [README](/README.md) file to indicate that this code was used and where, and that the project as a whole is termporarily licensed under the LGPL v2.1
